#HTML, CSS and JS challenge

I have found a interesting Figma template and have desided to realise it with HTML, CSS and JS

[Figma template](https://www.figma.com/file/UDhNYLmPfQRLU8gbelhejv/Lawyer-Landing-Page---Lawliet-(Community)).

Here you can see how it looks - Demo website - [Lawliet landing](https://lawliet.surge.sh/).

This site was built using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, jQuery
